# CS_Boston_house_price

This is a weekly project from Coderschool bootcamp. 

In this project, I will look into the Boston Housing price collected in 1978, with 4 aspects: 
  - RM (average number of room in the neighborhood).
  - LSTAT (percentage of homeowners in the neighbors that are considered "lower class" (working class)).
  - PTRATIO (ratio of the students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood).
  - MEDV (the average price of the house)
